# RPS Technical Assessment May 2023

## Task

![Task mockup consisting of a block hero at the top of the page and 6 tiles below laid out in a 3x2 grid.](https://rps.pix8.co.uk/ref/mockup.jpg "Mockup")

Please build a responsive page based on the mockup. It should contain the following 

**Image carousel with 3 or more slides**  
Each slide should contain an image, heading and CTA

**Six CTA blocks**  
Each block should contain an image and a CTA 

Build the page using only HTML, CSS/SCSS and Javascript. No frameworks or libraries should be used. 

If required, please include the package.json file.

> *Candidate notes: Imagery supplied by client and the unsuitable aspect ratios, poor subject matter and unworkable framing was noted. I did try to alleviate this major oversight with some clever usage of responsive imagery but there is a limit to my superpowers when people are too lazy to pick workable images that compliment the task they ask you to perform. Really not sure who's being assessed for competency and attention to detail here. Although I received positive feedback that I had passed with flying colours the work that was promised failed to materialised and this exercised proved to be a complete and utter waste of my time so my strong vocal criticism is justified.*
